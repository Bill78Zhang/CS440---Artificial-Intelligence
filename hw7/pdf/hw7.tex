\noindent \textbf{1. } Conceptual Questions \\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the example space, \textbf{\textit{X}}, for this problem? \\
	Since the input can be {0, 0.5, 1}, \textbf{\textit{X}} is 3-dimensional real space $R^3$
	\item Which model do you expect to be more expressive: a binary classifier perceptron or a binary classifier multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer? Why? \\
	A binary classifier multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer will be more expressive, it has more VC dimensions then the former and thus will be the richer model and be able to represent more things.
	\item Which one of the models described in question 2 do you think is more likely to overfit, and why? \\
	Even though the multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer will be more expressive, it is also more likely to overfit when you do not have enough data.
	\item Do you expect your perceptron to converge (assuming a constant learning rate)? Why or why not? \\
	Yes, because it seems there is plenty of data available to properly train the perceptron, and the data can be properly separated into positive and negative examples by a hyperplane

\noindent \textbf{2. } Implementing a Perceptron \\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Learning rate decays. Training example is randomized with Fisher-Yates shuffle. Weight initialized to 0.
	\item Only about 5 epochs were necessary to train the perceptron to hit the minimum 80\%. However given 400 epochs, the perceptron will lead to \~95\% accuracy.
	\item 94\~96\%.
	\item 95\%.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{2. } Using a Multilayer Perceptron \\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which combinations of hyperparameters did you try, and which combination worked best?
	\item How many epochs were necessary to train your multilayer perceptron?
	\item What accuracy did you achieve on the training set?
	\item What accuracy did you achieve on the test set?	
	\item How did the results obtained using the multilayer perceptron compare to those obtained using the single-layer perceptron in part 2? Explain the differences.
